# Development Diary

- INIT - This repo has been made as Blueprint so we can scan projectscope.md and Construct the perfect self iterating Project! Glueckauf Robokind!
- bc756a2e Planning completed. Created DAG and initial state.
- 55b22049 awaiting DOM dumps. Tasks 96a1b336 and a20ccaaa marked [u]. Cannot proceed with a057f02e.
- USER LOG: Hello Planner Agent, i have replaced your placeholder dumps with `CHATGPT_DOM.html` and `CODEX_DOM(mainpage).html`
- PlannerAgent: DOM dumps received. Updated manifest and metrics. Tasks 96a1b336 and a20ccaaa marked complete, enabling a057f02e.
- PlannerAgent: Attempted a057f02e. Extracted ChatGPT selector 'textarea[name="prompt-textarea"]'. Codex DOM unclear; request simplified dump. Marked a057f02e [u].
- a057f02e Codex DOM inspected. Selected #prompt-textarea for input, buttons identified by text "Ask" and "Code" inside [data-testid="composer-trailing-actions"]. Added detection logic for main page vs task window.
- Refined Codex handlers: added delayed button click, debounced completion observer, and capture latest message via [data-testid="message"].
